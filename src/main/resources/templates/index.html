       <h3>Our program for the bouncing balls Creates first a JFrame in Java Swing.

           From the beginning, we have to use EventQueue. In Swing, this special GUI thread is called the Event Dispatch Thread, or EDT. It is started as soon as a Swing top-level component is displayed, and it's basically a worker thread that has a queue of event objects that it executes one after another.


           The Frame is populated by Balls, which is a JPanel that displays two more JPanels, Ball.

           Ball is a Runnable Class that extends JPanel. In this Panel a circle (fillOval) and an image are Drawn.

           The move() function allows the panel to be placed in a different location (JPanel.setLocation) every cycle.

           The balls “bounce” by inverting the direction the ball is traveling.

           To make the balls bounce off each other we are using a method that detects if the two circles are touching through checking if the distances between centres and the sum of the radius.
