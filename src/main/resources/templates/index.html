    <p>Our program for the bouncing balls Creates first a JFrame in Java Swing.</p>

    <p> From the beginning, we have to use EventQueue. In Swing, this special GUI thread is called the Event Dispatch
        Thread, or EDT.</p>
    <p>  It is started as soon as a Swing top-level component is displayed, and it's basically a worker
        thread that has a queue of event objects that it executes one after another.</p>


        The Frame is populated by Balls, which is a JPanel that displays two more JPanels, Ball.

        Ball is a Runnable Class that extends JPanel. In this Panel a circle (fillOval) and an image are Drawn.

        The move() function allows the panel to be placed in a different location (JPanel.setLocation) every cycle.

        The balls “bounce” by inverting the direction the ball is traveling.

        To make the balls bounce off each other we are using a method that detects if the two circles are touching
        through
        checking if the distances between centres and the sum of the radius.
